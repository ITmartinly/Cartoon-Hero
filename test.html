<!--HTML is a way to display information on a website understood by the browser & interacted with the users.
	A website is a series of webpages. These webpages are structed into boxes which are represented as ELEMENTS consisting of an <opening tag> <contents> & </closing tag>.
	Information on how to display these elements are referred as ATTRIBUTES. Ex.img src="" you cannot put anything inside an attribute that's why there is no closing tag.
